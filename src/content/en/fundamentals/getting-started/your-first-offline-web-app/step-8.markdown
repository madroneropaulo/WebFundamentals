Give a little honk of the air horn. You now have a web app that can work 
offline. If everything was set up correctly, you should see your debug
statements appearing in the Log section of your service worker on the
`chrome://serviceworker-internals/` page.

Give it a functional test by stopping the Python server from Step 5. Hit **Ctrl C**
to stop the server, then refresh the air horn page now that the server is no
longer running. If the app still loads, the service worker is functioning properly.
