      There are two types of app install banners: <i>web</i> app install 
      banners and <i>native</i> app install banners. They give you the ability 
      to let users quickly and seamlessly add your web or native app to their 
      home screens without leaving the browser.

      <i>"This looks great, I want it on my site!"</i>
    </p>

      <i>"Please tell me how to add it!"</i>

      Adding app install banners is easy, and Chrome handles most of the heavy
      lifting for you. You'll need to include a web app manifest file in
      your site with details about your app.

      Chrome then uses a set of criteria and visit frequency heuristics to 
      determine when to show the banner. Read on for more details.
